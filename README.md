# TB-HIV-Coinfection-Network-Pharmacology-Modeling
Key words: TB/HIV coinfection, Multi-dimensional graphs, Systems biology, predictive modeling, drug discovery

Description:Â This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TB/HIV coinfection through multi-dimensional graph-based modeling. The extracted information from this modeling will be utilized for biomarker identification, QSAR modeling, and virtual screening efforts. Additionally, the project seeks to understand the impact of environmental toxicology on disease progression and occurrence.
